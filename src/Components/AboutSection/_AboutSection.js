          Leadership Conference has always been about
          reaching out to business leaders, churches,
          startups, CEOs, and industry leaders to help
          them understand, equip, and grow themselves
          and their organizations to reach the world
          around them.

          For the past 10 years, we have seen and heard
          from thousands of our attendees their successes
          as a result of their time at Leadership Conference.

          We don’t take it lightly. That’s why we have
          dedicated ourselves to bringing in the top leaders
          in their respective fields. We don’t ask for one-hour
          motivational pep talks. We require a comprehensive,
          tried-and-true plan to implement success.
